# So long and thanks for all the fish

They say all good things must come to an end. Unfortunately, this is the end of Studyscraper. I received an email from Studydrive, and I have to shut down the service. I hope you enjoyed using Studyscraper as much as I enjoyed building it. Thank you for your support and good luck with the rest of your studies!

## What now?

A friend of mine is currently building a completely free platform for students to share and download documents. It will be available on [ghostudy.de](https://ghostudy.de) soon.
